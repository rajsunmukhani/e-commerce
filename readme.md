This was the code made by me in a node js examination conducted by theSheryians Coding School, under which this made me secure second position.

It is a E-Commerce website, which works really well, fully designed and developed by me, taking an inpiration from a design on Pinterest, and a pinch of my creativity in making animation.

1. In this website you can use the nav links to direct yourself on home page.
2. You can login as a seller or consumer.
3. If you login as a seller you can view adminDashboard as well as shop, but if you login as consumer you can only view the dedicated shop.
4. You can add items to cart.
5. Increase and decrease items in cart.
6. Remove items directsly from cart.
7. Checkout and see the trial version of razorpay working succesfully.
8. While uploading the images, you can upload atmost 3 images at a time, being a seller.
9. You can logout from profile by clicking on your name.
10. User is authenticated and the pages can not be excessed without login.


I will be making changes regularly and make it more interesting.
